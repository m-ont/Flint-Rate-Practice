# Useless-Flint-Rate-Practice-Map
By Montage (mont_)

Minecraft map for practicing flint rates (very necessary)

Notes: 

If the Info Text or the Scoreboard is not working properly, break the lamp outside the map.
Make sure to pick up the items for the counter to work properly.
You can reset by dropping the shovel.
